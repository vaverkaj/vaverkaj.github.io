        This is a project that I am currently working on. It's an application
        that allows employees of Česká spořitelna arrange special price offers
        for customers. I work in a team of 10 people and we practice
        <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum">SCRUM</a>. This project
        taught me the importance of good communication and value of well done
        analysis. During the development, the systems we depended on, were often
        unavailable. Thanks to the analysis I was able to create
        <a hraf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mocks</a>, and
        continue with development even without working backend systems. This is
        also the first project that we decided to fully cover with automated
        frontend tests.

        <p label>Pension Store</p>
        First project that I worked on in Česká spořitelna. It is currently
        deployed in George and if any one of the 4,5 million clients wants to
        arrange pension saving account he will be redirected to this
        application. During this project I learned to work in an agile team and
        use a lot of new tools like Figma, Enterprise Architect, TeamCity and
        Swagger. I was able to setup CI builds, that run tests and check static
        code analysis before every pull request.

        <p type>Feature Project</p>
        <p label>Wordpress Plugin for video playback</p>
        As a part of my master's thesis, I developed a plugin that allows users
        to create, publish, and watch videos on a website called
        <a href="https://catvusa.com/">www.catvusa.com</a>. I collaborated
        closely with the website's owner to ensure a smooth deployment and
        migration. This project taught me the challenges of working remotely and
        handling clients' expectations. It also allowed me to flex a lot of my
        abilities, from developing the video editor and player in JavaScript and
        PHP, all the way to deployment and migration that required me to create
        generators for migration scripts in SQL. I worked on this project alone
        and was able to manage my own timeline and project scope.
